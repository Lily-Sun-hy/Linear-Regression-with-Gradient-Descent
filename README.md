# Linear-Regression-with-Gradient-Descent

In this project, linear regression with vanilla gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent is implemented to predict the status of an airplane via training on an open-source airplane features dataset.

The effect of batch sizes is also investigated by using different batch sizes and comparing the root-mean-square error, the amount of training time used and the number of training epocs used.

Additionally, the effect of learning rate on the model convergence is investigated. Static learning rate and adaptive learning rate with different values are used, and different adaptive methods (step decay and exponential decay) are tested as well.

Moreover, additional features are added using built-in sklearn functions and the sklearn built-in linear regression is applied to data with the additional features. Meanwhile, L2 regularization is applied to reduce model complexity and overcome overfitting.

Finally, a new dataset is used to validate and optimize a linear regression model using the approaches above.
